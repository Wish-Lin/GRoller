### Added

- Everything up to this point. The development of GRoller started in December 2025.
- First push to GitHub. This is the first version of the software that is usable by me, the developer.
- Current status of the program:
    - File IO is only partially complete.
    - UI currently includes a compilation status console, an editor, and an output window.
    - Can work with almost all RS-274-D G-code (the "core" G-code), with basic error handling & code diagnostic abilities.
